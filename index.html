                                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for

                                <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
                                <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Properties: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic
                                                features (e.g., font, width, background color) you want to
                                                change.</li>
                                        <li>Values: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates
                                                how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g., what you
                                                want to change the font, width, or background color to.)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations
                                        are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration
                                        blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).
                                </p>
                                <p>The below image highlights a single property and value. The property name is
                                        <code>color</code>, and the value <code>blue</code></p>

                                <!-- Code Block -->
                                <pre><code>h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: yellow;</span>
}

p {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: red;</span>
}</code></pre>

                                <p>Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS
                                        Rulesets (or CSS Rules). Our image contains two rules, one for the
                                        <code>h1</code> selector and one for the <code>p</code> selector. The
                                        rule for <code>h1</code> is highlighted.</p>

                                <!-- Code Block -->
                                <pre><code>h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: yellow;</span>
}
                
p {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: red;</span>
}</code></pre>

                                <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS
                                        language. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every
                                        single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style
                                        it. What is important to remember is that both properties and values are
                                        case-sensitive in CSS. The property and value in each pair is separated
                                        by a colon (<code>:</code>).</p>

                                <!-- Applying CSS to your HTML -->
                                <h2>Applying CSS to your HTML</h2>
                                <p>There are three methods of applying CSS to a document.</p>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>External stylesheet</li>
                                        <li>Internal stylesheet</li>
                                        <li>Inline styles</li>
                                </ul>

                                <!-- External Stylesheet -->
                                <h4>External stylesheet</h4>

                                <P>The most common and useful method of styling HTML is using an external
                                        stylesheet page. This method allows for the CSS to be linked to multiple
                                        pages</P>
                                <p>An external stylesheet is when you have your CSS written in a separate file
                                        with a <code>.css</code> extension, and you reference it from an HTML
                                        <code>&#60link&#62</code> element:</p>

                                <!-- Code Block -->

                                <p>The CSS file might look something like this:</p>

                                        times per document), and it also mixes your presentational CSS
                                        information with your HTML structural information, making the code

                                <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that
                                        we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available,
                                        allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. In
                                        this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types
                                        in great detail, seeing how they work.</p>

                                <h2>What is a selector?</h2>
                                <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements
                                        and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be
                                        selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to
                                        them.</p>
                                
                                <!-- Code Block -->
                                <pre><code>h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: yellow;</span>
}

p {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: red;</span>
}</code></pre>

                                <!-- Selector Lists -->
                                <h2>Selector lists</h2>
                                <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual
                                        selectors can be combined into a selector list so that the rule is
                                        applied to all of the individual selectors. For example, if I have the
                                        same CSS for an <code>h1</code> and also a class of
                                        <code>.special</code>, I could write this as two separate rules.</p>

<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
}</code></pre>

                                <p>These selectors can be combined into a selector list, by adding a comma
                                        between them.</p>

}</code></pre>

                                <p>White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the
                                        selectors more readable if each is on a new line.</p>

                                <p>This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states
                                        of an element. The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class for example selects
                                        an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:</p>

                                        rather than the element itself. For example, <code>::first-line</code>
                                        always selects the first line of text inside an element (a
                                        <code>&#60p&#62</code> in the below case), acting as if a
                                        <code>&#60span&#62</code> was wrapped around the first formatted line
                                        and then selected.</p>

                                        elements using the child combinator (<code>></code>):</p>

                                example we have used span, em and strong selectors. All instances of

                                all elements. This means that instead of the default styling added by the
                                browser, which spaces out headings and paragraphs with margins, everything is
                                close together and we can't see the different paragraphs easily.</p>

                        <p>This kind of behavior can sometimes be seen in "reset stylesheets', which strip out
                                all of the browser styling. These were very popular at one point, however
                                stripping out all styling usually meant that you then had to do the job of
                                putting it all back! We tend to use the universal selector carefully therefore,
                                to deal with very specific situations such as the one outlined below.</p>

                        <!-- Using the universal selector to make your selectors easire to read -->
                        <h4>Using the universal selector to make your selectors easier to read</h4>

                        <p>One use of the universal selector is to make selectors easier to read and more
                                obvious in terms of what they are doing. For example, if I wanted to select the
                                first child of any &#60article&#62 element, no matter what element it was, and
                                make it bold, I could use the <code>:first-child</code> selector, which we will
                                learn more about in the lesson on <a
                                        href="#Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements">pseudo-classes and
                                        pseudo-elements</a>, as a descendant selector along with the
                                &#60article&#62 element selector: </p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>aritcle :first-child {

}</code></pre>

                        <p>This could be confused however with <code>article:first-child</code>, which will
                                select any <code>&#60article&#62</code> element that is the first child of
                                another element.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this confusion we can add the universal selector to the
                                <code>:first-child</code> selector, so it is obvious what the selector is doing.
                                It is selecting any element which is the first-child of an
                                <code>&#60article&#62</code> element:</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>article *:first-child {

                        <!-- Class Selectors -->
                        <h2>Class selectors</h2>

                        <p>The class selector starts with a full stop (<code>.</code>) character and will select
                                everything in the document with that class applied to it.</p>

                        <h4>Targetting classes on particular elements</h4>

                        <p>You can create a selector that will target specific elements with the class applied.
                                We do this by using the type selector for the element I want to target, with the
                                class appended, with no white space inbetween.</p>

                        <p>This approach does make the CSS less reusable as the class will now only apply to
                                that particular element, and you would need to add another selector if you
                                decided that the rules should apply to other elements too.</p>

                        <!-- Target an element if it has more than one class applied -->
                        <h4>Target an element if it has more than one class applied</h4>

                        <p>You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them individually, or only
                                select the element when all of the classes in the selector are present. This can
                                be helpful when building up components that can be combined in different ways on
                                your site.</p>
                        <p>We can tell the browser that we only want to match the element if it has all of these
                                classes by chaining them together with no white space between them.</p>

                        <!-- ID Selectors -->
                        <h4>ID Selectors</h4>

                        <p>An ID selector begins with a <code>#</code> rather than a full stop character, but is
                                basically used in the same way as a class selector. An ID however can be used
                                only once per document. It can select an element that has the <code>id</code>
                                set on it, and you can precede the ID with a type selector to only target the
                                element if both the element and ID match. You can see both of these uses in the
                                following example:</p>

                                <code>box-error</code> and wanted to match everything that started with the
                                string "box-", you could use <code>[class^="box-"]</code> to select them both.

                                <li><code>li[class$="a"]</code> matches any attribute value that ends with a, so
                                        matches the first and third list item.</li>
                                <li><code>li[class*="a"]</code> matches any attribute value where a appears
                                        anywhere in the string, so it matches all of our list items.</li>

                        <!-- Case-Sensitivity -->
                        <h2>Case-sensitivity</h2>

                        <p>If you want to match attribute values case-insensitively you can use the value
                                <code>i</code> before the closing bracket. This flag tells the browser to match
                                ASCII characters case-insensitively. Without the flag the values will be matched
                                according to the case-sensitivity of the document language â€” in HTML's case it
                                will be case sensitive.</p>

                        <p>In the example below, the first selector will match a value that begins with a â€” it
                                only matches the first list item because the other two list items start with an
                                uppercase A. The second selector uses the case-insensitive flag and so matches
                                all of the list items.</p>

                        <p>A psuedo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g.
                                they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the
                                mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of
                                your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and
                                giving you more flexible, maintainable code.</p>

                        <p>Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon:</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->

                        <p>Let's look at a simple example. If we wanted to make the first paragraph in an
                                article larger and bold, we could add a class to that paragraph and then add CSS
                                to that class, as shown in the first example below:</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.first {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">font-size: 120%;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">font-weight: bold;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60article&#62

&#60/article&#62</code></pre>

                        <p>However, this could be annoying to maintain â€” what if a new paragraph got added to
                                the top of the document? We'd need to move the class over to the new paragraph.
                                Instead of adding the class, we could use the <code>:first-child</code>
                                pseudo-class selector â€” this will always target the first child element in the
                                article, and we wll no longer need to edit the HTML (this may not always be
                                possible anyway, maybe due to it being generated by a CMS.)</p>

                        <p>All pseudo-classes behave in this same kind of way. They target some bit of your
                                document that is in a certain state, behaving as if you had added a class into
                                your HTML. Take a look at some other examples on MDN:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li><code>:last-child</code></li>

                        <h4>User-action pseudo classes</h4>

                        <p>Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way.
                                These <b>user-action</b> pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as <b>dynamic
                                        pseudo-classes</b>, act as if a class had been added to the element when
                                the user interacts with it. Examples include:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li><code>:hover</code> â€” mentioned above; this only applies if the user moves
                                        their pointer over an element, typically a link.</li>
                                <li><code>:focus</code> â€” only applies if the user focuses the element using
                                        keyboard controls.</li>

                        <p>Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole
                                new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing
                                elements. Pseudo-elements start with a double colon <code>::</code>.</p>

                        <p>For example, if you wanted to select the first line of a paragraph you could wrap it
                                in a <code>&#60span&#62</code> element and use an element selector; however,
                                that would fail if the number of words you had wrapped were longer or shorter
                                than the parent element's width. As we tend not to know how many words will fit
                                on a line â€” as that will change if the screen width or font-size changes â€” it is
                                impossible to robustly do this by adding HTML.</p>
                        <p>The <code>::first-line</code> pseudo-element selector will do this for you reliably â€”
                                if the number of words increases and decreases it will still only select the
                                first line.</p>

                                that we want to select the first line, of the first &#60p&#62 element, which is
                                inside an <code>&#60article&#62</code> element.</p>

                        <h2>Generatign content with ::before and ::after</h2>
                        <p>There are a couple of special pseudo-elements, which are used along with the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content"
                                        target="_blank">content</a> property to insert content into your
                                document using CSS.</p>

                        <p>You could use these to insert a string of text, such as in the live example below.
                                Try changing the text value of the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content"
                                        target="_blank">content</a> property and see it change in the output.
                                You could also change the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element to
                                <code>::after</code> and see the text inserted at the end of the element instead
                                of the beginning.</p>

                        <p>Inserting strings of text from CSS isn't really something we do very often on the web
                                however, as that text is inaccessible to some screen readers and might be hard
                                for someone to find and edit in the future.</p>

                        <p>A more valid use of these pseudo-elements is to insert an icon, for example the
                                little arrow added in the example below, which is a visual indicator that we
                                wouldn't want read out by a screenreader:</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.box::after {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">content: " âž¥"</span>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60p class="box"&#62Content in the box in my HTML page.&#60/p&#62</code></pre>

                        <p>These pseudo-elements are also frequently used to insert an empty string, which can
                                then be styled just like any element on the page.</p>

                        <p>In this next example, we have added two empty strings using the <code>::before</code>
                                and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. We have set these to <code>display:
                                        block</code> in order that we can style them with a width and height. We
                                then use CSS to style them just like any element. You can play around with the
                                CSS and change how these look and behave.</p>

                        <p>The use of the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements along
                                with the content property is referred to as "Generated Content" in CSS, and you
                                will often see this technique being used for various tasks in CSS. A great
                                example is the site <a href="http://www.cssarrowplease.com" target="_blank">CSS
                                        Arrow Please</a>, which helps you to generate an arrow with CSS. Look at
                                the CSS as you create your arrow and you will see the <code><a
                                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before"

                                                target="_blank">::after</a></code> pseudo-elements in use.
                                Whenever you see these selectors, look at the <a

                        <!-- Descendant selector -->
                        <h2>Descendant selector</h2>
                        <p>You have already come across descendant selectors in previous lessons â€” selectors
                                with spaces in between them:</p>

                        <code>body article p</code>

                        <p>These selectors select elements that are descendants of others selector. They do not
                                need to be direct children to match.</p>

                        <p>In the example below we are matching only the <code>&#60p&#62</code> element which is
                                inside an element with a class of <code>.box</code>.</p>

                        <h2>Child combinator</h2>
                        <p>The child combinator is a greater-than symbol (<code>></code>), which matches only
                                when the selectors select elements that are direct children. Descendants further
                                down the hierarchy don't match. For example, to select only
                                <code>&#60p&#62</code> elements that are direct children of
                                <code>&#60article&#62</code> elements:</p>

                        <code>article > p</code>

                        <p>In this next example we have an unordered list, nested inside of which is another
                                unordered list. I am using the child combinator to select only the
                                <code>&#60li&#62</code> elements which are a direct child of a
                                <code>&#60ul&#62</code>, and have given them a top border.</p>

                        <p>If you remove the <code>></code> that designates this as a child combinator, you end
                                up with a descendant selector and all <code>&#60li&#62</code> elements will get
                                a red border.</p>

                        <p>The adjacent sibling selector (<code>+</code>) is used to select something if it is
                                right next to another element at the same level of the hierarchy. For example,
                                to select all <code>&#60img&#62</code> elements that come right after
                                <code>&#60p&#62</code> elements:</p>

                        <code>p + img</code>

                        <p>A common use case is to do something with a paragraph that follows a heading, as in
                                my example below. Here we are looking for a paragraph which is directly adjacent
                                to an <code>&#60h1&#62</code>, and styling it.</p>

                        <p>If you insert some other element such as a <code>&#60h2&#62</code> in between the
                                <code>&#60h1&#62</code> and the <code>&#60p&#62</code>, you will find that the
                                paragraph is no longer matched by the selector and so does not get the
                                background and foreground color applied when the element is adjacent.</p>

                                then you can use the general sibling combinator (<code>~</code>). To select all

                                that comes after it is selected.</p>

                        <!-- Using Combinators -->
                        <h2>Using combinators</h2>
                        <p>You can combine any of the selectors that we discovered in previous lessons with
                                combinators in order to pick out part of your document. For example if we want
                                to select list items with a class of "a", which are direct children of a
                                <code>&#60ul&#62</code>, I could use the following.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>ul > li[class="a"] { }</code></pre>

                        <p>Take care however when creating big lists of selectors that select very specific
                                parts of your document. It will be hard to reuse the CSS rules as you have made
                                the selector very specific to the location of that element in the markup.</p>

                        <p>It is often better to create a simple class and apply that to the element in
                                question. That said, your knowledge of combinators will come in very useful if
                                you need to get to something in your document and are unable to access the HTML,
                                perhaps due to it being generated by a CMS.</p>

                                you can use any valid color as a value for that property, as listed on the
                                <code>&#60color&#62</code> reference page.</p>

                        <p>In the following example we have set the color of our heading using a keyword, and
                                the background using the <code>rgb()</code> function:</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: black;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: rgb(197, 93, 161);</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <p>A value in CSS is a way to define a collection of allowable sub-values. This means
                                that if you see <code>&#60color&#62</code> as valid you don't need to wonder
                                which of the different types of color value can be used â€” keywords, hex values,
                                <code>rgb()</code> functions, etc. You can use any available
                                <code>&#60color&#62</code> values assuming they are supported by your browser.
                                The page on MDN for each value will give you information about browser support.
                                For example, if you look at the page for <code>&#60color&#62</code> you will see
                                that the browser compatibility section lists different types of color value and
                                support for them.</p>

                        <p>Let's have a look at some of the types of value and unit you may frequently
                                encounter, with examples so that you can try out different possible values.</p>

                        <!-- Numbers, lengths, and percentages -->
                        <h2>Numbers, lengths, and percentages</h2>
                        <p>There are various numeric data types that you might find yourself using in CSS.

                        <!-- Lenghts -->
                        <h4>Lengths</h4>

                        <p>The numeric type you will come across most frequently is <code>&#60length&#62</code>,
                                for example <code>10px</code> (pixels) or <code>30em</code>. There are two types
                                of lengths used in CSS â€” relative and absolute. It's important to know the
                                difference in order to understand how big things will become.</p>

                        <h3>Relative length units</h3>
                        <p>Relative length units are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent
                                element's font, or the size of the viewport. The benefit of using relative units
                                is that with some careful planning you can make it so the size of text or other
                                elements scale relative to everything else on the page. Please refer to the
                                table on the <a

                        <!-- Exploring an example -->
                        <h3>Exploring an example</h3>

                        <p>In the example below you can see how some relative and absolute length units behave.
                                The first box has a <code>width</code> set in pixels. As an absolute unit this
                                width will remain the same no matter what else changes.</p>

                        <p>The second box has a width set in <code>vw</code> (viewport width) units. This value
                                is relative to the viewport width, and so 10vw is 10 percent of the width of the
                                viewport. If you change the width of your browser window, the size of the box
                                should change, however this example is embedded into the page using an
                                <code>&#60iframe&#62</code>, so this won't work. To see this in action you'll
                                have to <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/values-units/length.html"
                                        target="_blank">try the example after opening it in its own browser
                                        tab.</a></p>

                        <p>The third box uses em units. These are relative to the font size. I've set a font
                                size of <code>1em</code> on the containing <code>&#60div&#62</code>, which has a
                                class of <code>.wrapper</code>. Change this value to <code>1.5em</code> and you
                                will see that the font size of all the elements increases, but only the last
                                item will get wider, as the width is relative to that font size.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.wrapper {

                        <!-- ems and rems -->
                        <h3>ems and rems</h3>
                        <p><code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> are the two relative lengths you are likely to
                                encounter most frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text. It's worth
                                understanding how these work, and the differences between them, especially when
                                you start getting on to more complex subjects like styling text or CSS layout.
                                The below example provides a demonstration.</p>

                        <p>The HTML is a set of nested lists â€” we have three lists in total and both examples
                                have the same HTML. The only difference is that the first has a class of ems and
                                the second a class of rems.</p>

                        <p>To start with, we set 16px as the font size on the <code>&#60html&#62</code> element.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>To recap, the em unit means "my parent element's font-size".</b> The
                                <code>&#60li&#62</code> elements inside the <code>&#60ul&#62</code> with a
                                <code>class</code> of <code>ems</code> take their sizing from their parent. So
                                each successive level of nesting gets progressively larger, as each has its font
                                size set to <code>1.3em</code> â€” 1.3 times its parent's font size.</p>

                        <p><b>To recap, the rem unit means "The root element's font-size".</b> (rem standards
                                for "root em".) The <code>&#60li&#62</code> elements inside the
                                <code>&#60ul&#62</code> with a <code>class</code> of <code>rems</code> take
                                their sizing from the root element (<code>&#60html&#62</code>). This means that
                                each successive level of nesting does not keep getting larger.</p>

                        <p>However, if you change the <code>&#60html&#62</code> <code>font-size</code> in the
                                CSS you will see that everything else changes relative to it â€” both
                                <code>rem</code>- and <code>em</code>-sized text.</p>

                        <!-- Percentages -->
                        <h4>Percentages</h4>

                        <p>In a lot of cases a percentage is treated in the same way as a length. The thing with
                                percentages is that they are always set relative to some other value. For
                                example, if you set an element's <code>font-size</code> as a percentage it will
                                be a percentage of the <code>font-size</code> of the element's parent. If you
                                use a percentage for a <code>width</code> value, it will be a percentage of the
                                <code>width</code> of the parent.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the example and code on the <a
                                        href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/values-units/length.html"

                        <p>Note that, while many values accept a length or a percentage, there are some that
                                only accept length. You can see which values are accepted on the MDN property
                                reference pages. If the allowed value includes
                                <code>&#60length-percentage&#62</code> then you can use a length or a
                                percentage. If the allowed value only includes <code>&#60length&#62</code>, it
                                is not possible to use a percentage.</p>

                        <!-- Numbers -->
                        <h4>Numbers</h4>

                        <p>Some values accept numbers, without any unit added to them. An example of a property
                                which accepts a unitless number is the <code>opacity</code> property, which
                                controls the opacity of an element (how transparent it is). This property
                                accepts a number between <code>0</code> (fully transparent) and <code>1</code>
                                (fully opaque).</p>

                        <!-- Color -->
                        <h2>Color</h2>
                        <p>There are many ways to specify color in CSS, some of which are more recently
                                implemented than others. The same color values can be used everywhere in CSS,
                                whether you are specifying text color, background color, or whatever else.</p>

                        <p>The standard color system available in modern computers is 24 bit, which allows the
                                display of about 16.7 million distinct colors via a combination of different
                                red, green and blue channels with 256 different values per channel (256 x 256 x
                                256 = 16,777,216.) Let's have a look at some of the ways in which we can specify
                                colors in CSS.</p>

                        <!-- Color Keywords -->
                        <h4>Color Keywords</h4>

                        <p>Quite often in examples here in the learn section or elsewhere on MDN you will see
                                the color keywords used, as they are a simple and understandable way of
                                specifying color. There are a number of these keywords, some of which have
                                fairly entertaining names! You can see a full list on the page for the
                                <code>&#60color&#62</code> value.</p>

                        <p><b>Try playing with different color values in the live examples below, to get more of
                                        an idea how they work.</b></p>

                        <!-- Hexadecimal RGB Values -->
                        <h4>Hexadecimal RGB values</h4>

                        <p>The next type of color value you are likely to encounter is hexadecimal codes. Each
                                hex value consists of a hash/pound symbol (#) followed by six hexadecimal
                                numbers, each of which can take one of 16 values between 0 and f (which
                                represents 15) â€” so <code>0123456789abcdef</code>. Each pair of values
                                represents one of the channels â€” red, green and blue â€” and allows us to specify
                                any of the 256 available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)</p>

                        <p>These values are a bit more complex and less easy to understand, but they are a lot
                                more versatile than keywords â€” you can use hex values to represent any color you
                                want to use in your color scheme.</p>

                        <!-- RGB and RGBA Values -->
                        <h4>RGB and RGBA values</h4>

                        <p>The third scheme we'll talk about here is RGB. An RGB value is a function â€”
                                <code>rgb()</code> â€” which is given three parameters that represent the red,
                                green, and blue channel values of the colors, in much the same way as hex
                                values. The difference with RGB is that each channel is represented not by two
                                hex digits, but by a decimal number between 0 and 255 â€” somewhat easier to
                                understand.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the example and code on the <a
                                        href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/values-units/length.html"
                                        target="_blank">MDN</a> website</p>

                        <p>You can also use RGBA colors â€” these work in exactly the same way as RGB colors, and
                                so you can use any RGB values, however there is a fourth value that represents
                                the alpha channel of the color, which controls opacity. If you set this value to
                                0 it will make the color fully transparent, whereas 1 will make it fully opaque.
                                Values in between give you different levels of transparency.</p>

                        <p>In an example on the <a
                                        href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/values-units/length.html"
                                        target="_blank">MDN</a> website I have added a background image to the
                                containing block of our colored boxes. I have then set the boxes to have
                                different opacity values â€” notice how the background shows through more when the
                                alpha channel value is smaller.</p>

                        <!-- HSL and HSLA Values -->
                        <h4>HSL and HSLA values</h4>

                        <p>Slightly less well-supported than RGB is the HSL color model (not supported on old
                                versions of IE), which was implemented after much interest from designers.
                                Instead of red, green, and blue values, the <code>hsl()</code> function accepts
                                hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the
                                16.7 million colors, but in a different way:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Hue:</b> The base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and
                                        360, representing the angles round a color wheel.</li>
                                <li><b>Saturation:</b> How saturated is the color? This takes a value from
                                        0â€“100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and
                                        100% is full color saturation</li>
                                <li><b>Lightness:</b> How light or bright is the color? This takes a value from
                                        0â€“100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100%
                                        is full light (it will appear completely white)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Just as RGB has RGBA, HSL has an HSLA equivalent, which gives you the same ability to
                                specify the alpha channel. We have demonstrated this by changing my RGBA example
                                to use HSLA colors which is on the <a

                        <p>You can use any of these color values in your projects. It is likely that for most
                                projects you will decide on a color palette and then use those colors â€” and your
                                chosen method of specifying color â€” throughout the whole project. You can mix
                                and match color models, however for consistency it is usually best if your
                                entire project uses the same one!</p>

                        <!-- Images -->
                        <h2>Images</h2>

                        <p>The <code>image</code> data type is used wherever an image is a valid value. This can
                                be an actual image file pointed to via a <code>url ()</code> function, or a
                                gradient.</p>

                        <p>In the example below we have demonstrated an image and a gradient in use as a value
                                for the CSS <code>background-image</code> property.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.image {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-image: url(star.png);</span>
}

.gradient {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(119,0,255,1) 39%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 100%);</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60div class="box image"&#62&#60/div&#62
&#60div class="box gradient"&#62&#60/div&#62</code></pre>

                        <!-- Position -->
                        <h2>Position</h2>

                        <p>The <code>position</code> data type represents a set of 2D coordinates, used to
                                position an item such as a background image (via
                                <code>background-position</code>). <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>,
                                <code>bottom</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>center</code> to align items
                                with specific bounds of a 2D box, along with lengths, which represent offsets
                                from the top and left-hand edges of the box.</p>

                        <p>A typical position value consists of two values â€” the first sets the position
                                horizontally, the second vertically. If you only specify values for one axis the
                                other will default to <code>center</code>.</p>

                        <p>In the following example we have positioned a background image 40px from the top and
                                to the right of the container using a keyword.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.box {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">height: 300px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">width: 400px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-image: url(star.png);</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-repeat: no-repeat;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-position: right 40px;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60div class="box"&#62&#60/div&#62</code></pre>

                        <!-- Strings and identifiers -->
                        <h2>Strings and identifiers</h2>

                        <p>Throughout the examples above, we've seen places where keywords are used as a value
                                (for example <code>&#60color&#62</code> keywords like <code>red</code>,
                                <code>black</code>, <code>rebeccapurple</code>, and <code>goldenrod</code>).
                                These keywords are more accurately described as identifiers, a special value
                                that CSS understands. As such they are not quoted â€” they are not treated as
                                strings.</p>

                        <p>There are places where you use strings in CSS, for example when specifying generated
                                content. In this case the value is quoted to demonstrate that it is a string. In
                                the below example we use unquoted color keywords along with a quoted generated
                                content string.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.box {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">width:400px;</span>

<span class="code-block-tab-1">border-radius: .5em;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: lightblue;</span>
}

.box::after {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">content: "This is a string. I know because it is quoted in the CSS."</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60div class="box"&#62&#60/div&#62</code></pre>

                        <!-- Functions -->
                        <h2>Functions</h2>

                        <p>The final type of value we will take a look at is the group of values known as
                                functions. In programming, a function is a reusable section of code that can be
                                run multiple times to complete a repetitive task with minimum effort on the part
                                of both the developer and the computer. Functions are usually associated with
                                languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++, but they do exist in CSS too, as
                                property values. We've already seen functions in action in the Colors section â€”
                                <code>rgb()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>, etc. The value used to return an image
                                from a file â€” <code>url()</code> â€” is also a function.</p>

                        <p>A value that behaves more like something you might find in a traditional programming
                                language is the <code>calc()</code> CSS function. This function gives you the
                                ability to do simple calculations inside your CSS. It's particularly useful if
                                you want to work out values that you can't define when writing the CSS for your
                                project, and need the browser to work out for you at runtime.</p>

                        <p>For example, below we are using <code>calc()</code> to make the box <code>20% +
                                        100px</code> wide. The 20% is calculated from the width of the parent
                                container <code>.wrapper</code> and so will change if that width changes. We
                                can't do this calculation beforehand because we don't know what 20% of the
                                parent will be, so we use <code>calc()</code> to tell the browser to do it for
                                us.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.wrapper {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">width: 400px;</span>
}

.box {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">width: calc(20% + 100px);</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60div class="wrapper"&#62

                <!-- Cascade and Inheritance -->
                <section class="main-section" id="Cascade_and_Inheritance">
                        <header>Cascade and Inheritance</header>

                        <!-- Conflicting Rules -->
                        <h2>Conflicting rules</h2>

                        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that first word <i>cascading</i> is
                                incredibly important to understand â€” the way that the cascade behaves is key to
                                understanding CSS.</p>

                        <p>At some point, you will be working on a project and you will find that the CSS you
                                thought should be applied to an element is not working. Usually the problem is
                                that you have created two rules which could potentially apply to the same
                                element. The <b>cascade</b>, and the closely-related concept of
                                <b>specificity</b>, are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is
                                such a conflict. Which rule is styling your element may not be the one you
                                expect, so you need to understand how these mechanisms work.</p>

                        <p>Also significant here is the concept of <b>inheritance</b>, which means that some CSS
                                properties by default inherit values set on the current element's parent
                                element, and some don't. This can also cause some behavior that you might not
                                expect.</p>

                        <p>Let's start by taking a quick look at the key things we are dealing with, then we'll
                                look at each in turn and see how they interact with each other and your CSS.
                                This can seem like a set of tricky concepts to understand, however, as you
                                practice writing CSS the way that it works will become more obvious to you.</p>

                        <!-- The cascade -->
                        <h4>The cascade</h4>

                        <p>Stylesheets <b>cascade</b> â€” at a very simple level this means that the order of CSS
                                rules matter; when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that
                                comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.</p>

                        <p>In the below example, we have two rules that could apply to the <code>h1</code>. The
                                <code>h1</code> ends up being colored blue â€” these rules have an identical
                                selector and therefore carry the same specificity, so the last one in the source
                                order wins.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: red;</span>
}

h1 {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60h1&#62This is my heading.&#60/h1&#62</code></pre>

                        <!-- Specificity -->
                        <h4>Specificity</h4>

                        <p>Specificity is how the browser decides which rule applies if multiple rules have
                                different selectors, but could still apply to the same element. It is basically
                                a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>An element selector is less specific â€” it will select all elements of that
                                        type that appear on a page â€” so will get a lower score.</li>
                                <li>A class selector is more specific â€” it will select only the elements on a
                                        page that have a specific <code>class</code> attribute value â€” so will
                                        get a higher score.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Example time! Below we again have two rules that could apply to the <code>h1</code>.
                                The below <code>h1</code> ends up being colored red â€” the class selector gives
                                its rule a higher specificity, and so it will be applied even though the rule
                                with the element selector appears further down in the source order.</p>

                        <h4>Inheritance</h4>

                        <p>Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context â€” some CSS property values
                                set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
                        </p>

                        <p>For example, if you set a <code>color</code> and <code>font-family</code> on an
                                element, every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font,
                                unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>body {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: blue;</span>
}

span {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: black;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60p&#62As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through the descendants.&#60/p&#62
&#60p&#62We can change the color by targetting the element with a selector, such as this &#60span&#62span&#60/span&#62.&#60/p&#62</code></pre>

                        <p>Some properties do not inherit â€” for example if you set a <code>width</code> of 50%
                                on an element, all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their
                                parent's width. If this was the case, CSS would be very frustrating to use!</p>

                        <!-- Understanding Inheritance -->
                        <h2>Understanding inheritance</h2>
                        <p>We'll start with inheritance. In the example below we have a <code>ul</code>, with
                                two levels of unordered lists nested inside it. We have given the outer
                                <code>&#60ul&#62</code> a border, padding, and a font color.</p>

                        <p>The color has applied to the direct children, but also the indirect children â€” the
                                immediate child <code>&#60li&#62</code>s, and those inside the first nested
                                list. I have then added a class of <code>special</code> to the second nested
                                list and applied a different color to it. This then inherits down through its
                                children.</p>

                                inherit. If a border were to be inherited by the children of our list, every
                                single list and list item would gain a border â€” probably not an effect we would
                                ever want!</p>

                        <p>Which properties are inherited by default and which aren't is largely down to common
                                sense.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Controlling Inheritance -->
                        <h4>Controlling Inheritance</h4>

                        <p>CSS provides four special universal property values for controlling inheritance.
                                Every CSS property accepts these values.</p>

                        <!-- Inherit -->
                        <h5>inherit</h5>

                        <p>Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its
                                parent element. Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".</p>

                        <!-- Initial -->
                        <h5>initial</h5>
                        <p>Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as the value set
                                for that element in the browser's default style sheet. If no value is set by the
                                browser's default style sheet and the property is naturally inherited, then the
                                property value is set to inherit instead.</p>

                        <!-- Unset -->
                        <h5>unset</h5>
                        <p>Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is
                                naturally inherited it acts like <code>inherit</code>, otherwise it acts like
                                <code>initial</code>.</p>

                        <p>We can look at a list of links and explore how the universal values work. The live
                                example below allows you to play with the CSS and see what happens when you make
                                changes. Playing with code really is the best way to get to grips with HTML and
                                CSS.</p>

                        <p>For example:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li>The second list item has the class <code>my-class-1</code> applied. This
                                        sets the color of the a element nested inside to inherit. If you remove
                                        the rule how does it change the color of the link?</li>
                                <li>Do you understand why the third and fourth links are the color that they
                                        are? Check the description of the values above if not.</li>
                                <li>Which of the links will change color if you define a new color for the
                                        <code>&#60a&#62</code> element â€” for example <code>a { color: red;
                                                }</code>?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>body {

}

                        <!-- Resetting all property values -->
                        <h4>Resetting all property values</h4>

                        <p>The CSS shorthand property <code>all</code> can be used to apply one of these
                                inheritance values to (almost) all properties at once. Its value can be any one
                                of the inheritance values (<code>inherit</code>, <code>initial</code>,
                                <code>unset</code>, or <code>revert</code>). It's a convenient way to undo
                                changes made to styles so that you can get back to a known starting point before
                                beginning new changes.</p>

                        <p>In the below example I have two blockquotes. The first has styling applied to the
                                blockquote element itself, the second has a class applied to the blockquote
                                which sets the value of <code>all</code> to <code>unset</code>.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>blockquote {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: red;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">border: 2px solid green;</span>
}

.fix-this {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">all: unset;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60blockquote&#62

&#60blockquote class="fix-this"&#62
<span class="code-block-tab-1">&#60p&#62This blockquote is not styled&#60/p&#62</span>
&#60/blockquote&#62</code></pre>

                        <p>Try setting the value of <code>all</code> to some of the other available values and
                                observe what the difference is.</p>

                        <!-- Understanding the cascade -->
                        <h2>Understanding the cascade</h2>
                        <p>We now understand why a paragraph nested deep in the structure of your HTML is the
                                same color as the CSS applied to the body, and from the introductory lessons we
                                have an understanding of how to change the CSS applied to something at any point
                                in the document â€” whether by assigning CSS to an element or creating a class. We
                                will now take a proper look at how the cascade defines which CSS rules apply
                                when more than one thing could style an element.</p>

                        <p>There are three factors to consider, listed here in decreasing order of importance.
                                Earlier ones overrule later ones:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li>Importance</li>
                                <li>Specificity</li>
                                <li>Source order</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>We will look at these from the bottom up, to see how browsers figure out exactly what
                                CSS should be applied.</p>

                        <!-- Source Order -->
                        <h4>Source order</h4>

                        <p>We have already seen how source order matters to the cascade. If you have more than
                                one rule, which has exactly the same weight, then the one that comes last in the
                                CSS will win. You can think of this as rules which are nearer the element itself
                                overwriting early ones until the last one wins and gets to style the element.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Specificity -->
                        <h4>Specificity</h4>

                        <p>Once you understand the fact that source order matters, at some point you will run
                                into a situation where you know that a rule comes later in the stylesheet, but
                                an earlier, conflicting, rule is applied. This is because that earlier rule has
                                a <b>higher specificity</b> â€” it is more specific, and therefore is being chosen
                                by the browser as the one that should style the element.</p>

                        <p>As we saw earlier in this lesson, a class selector has more weight than an element
                                selector, so the properties defined on the class will override those applied
                                directly to the element.</p>

                        <p>Something to note here is that although we are thinking about selectors, and the
                                rules that are applied to the thing they select, it isn't the entire rule which
                                is overwritten, only the properties which are the same.</p>

                        <p>This behavior helps avoid repetition in your CSS. A common practice is to define
                                generic styles for the basic elements, and then create classes for those which
                                are different. For example, in the stylesheet below I have defined generic
                                styles for level 2 headings, and then created some classes which change only
                                some of the properties and values. The values defined initially are applied to
                                all headings, then the more specific values are applied to the headings with the
                                classes.</p>

                        <pre><code>h2 {

                        <p>Let's now have a look at how the browser will calculate specificity. We already know
                                that an element selector has low specificity and can be overwritten by a class.
                                Essentially a value in points is awarded to different types of selectors, and
                                adding these up gives you the weight of that particular selector, which can then
                                be assessed against other potential matches.</p>

                        <p>The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or
                                components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones â€”
                                four single digits in four columns:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li><b>Thousands:</b> Score one in this column if the declaration is inside a
                                        style attribute, aka inline styles. Such declarations don't have
                                        selectors, so their specificity is always simply 1000.</li>
                                <li><b>Hundreds:</b> Score one in this column for each ID selector contained
                                        inside the overall selector.</li>
                                <li><b>Tens:</b> Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute
                                        selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.</li>
                                <li><b>Ones:</b> Score one in this column for each element selector or
                                        pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Refer to the table on the <a

                        <p>So what's going on here? First of all, we are only interested in the first seven
                                rules of this example, and as you'll notice, we have included their specificity
                                values in a comment before each one.</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>The first two selectors are competing over the styling of the link's
                                        background color â€” the second one wins and makes the background color
                                        blue because it has an extra ID selector in the chain: its specificity
                                        is 201 vs. 101.</li>
                                <li>The third and fourth selectors are competing over the styling of the link's
                                        text color â€” the second one wins and makes the text white because
                                        although it has one less element selector, the missing selector is
                                        swapped out for a class selector, which is worth ten rather than one. So
                                        the winning specificity is 113 vs. 104.</li>
                                <li>Selectors 5â€“7 are competing over the styling of the link's border when
                                        hovered. Selector six clearly loses to five with a specificity of 23 vs.
                                        24 â€” it has one fewer element selectors in the chain. Selector seven,
                                        however, beats both five and six â€” it has the same number of
                                        sub-selectors in the chain as five, but an element has been swapped out
                                        for a class selector. So the winning specificity is 33 vs. 23 and 24.
                                </li>
                        </ul>

                        <!-- !important -->
                        <h4>!important</h4>

                        <p>There is a special piece of CSS that you can use to overrule all of the above
                                calculations, however you should be very careful with using it â€”
                                <code>!important</code>. This is used to make a particular property and value
                                the most specific thing, thus overriding the normal rules of the cascade.</p>

                        <p>Take a look at this example where we have two paragraphs, one of which has an ID.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>#winning {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: red;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">border: 1px solid black;</span>
}

.better {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: gray;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">border: none !important;</span>
}

p {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">background-color: blue;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">color: white;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">padding: 5px;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>&#60p class="better"&#62This is a paragraph.&#60/p&#62
&#60p class="better" id="winning"&#62One selector to rule them all!&#60/p&#62</code></pre>

                        <p>Let's walk through this to see what's happening â€” try removing some of the properties
                                to see what happens if you are finding it hard to understand:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li>You'll see that the third rule's <code>color</code> and <code>padding</code>
                                        values have been applied, but the <code>background-color</code> hasn't.
                                        Why? Really all three should surely apply, because rules later in the
                                        source order generally override earlier rules.</li>
                                <li>However, The rules above it win, because class selectors have higher
                                        specificity than element selectors.</li>
                                <li>Both elements have a <code>class</code> of <code>better</code>, but the 2nd
                                        one has an <code>id</code> of <code>winning</code> too. Since IDs have
                                        an even higher specificity than classes (you can only have one element
                                        with each unique ID on a page, but many elements with the same class â€”
                                        ID selectors are very specific in what they target), the red background
                                        color and the 1 pixel black border should both be applied to the 2nd
                                        element, with the first element getting the gray background color, and
                                        no border, as specified by the class.</li>
                                <li>The 2nd element does get the red background color, but no border. Why?
                                        Because of the <code>!important</code> declaration in the second rule â€”
                                        including this after <code>border: none</code> means that this
                                        declaration will win over the border value in the previous rule, even
                                        though the ID has higher specificity.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>It is useful to know that <code>!important</code> exists so that you know what it is
                                when you come across it in other people's code. <b>However, we strongly
                                        recommend that you never use it unless you absolutely have to.</b>
                                <code>!important</code> changes the way the cascade normally works, so it can
                                make debugging CSS problems really hard to work out, especially in a large
                                stylesheet.</p>

                        <p>One situation in which you may have to use it is when you are working on a CMS where
                                you can't edit the core CSS modules, and you really want to override a style
                                that can't be overridden in any other way. But really, don't use it if you can
                                avoid it.</p>

                        <!-- The effect of CSS location -->
                        <h2>The effect of CSS location</h2>
                        <p>Finally, it is also useful to note that the importance of a CSS declaration depends
                                on what stylesheet it is specified in â€” it is possible for users to set custom
                                stylesheets to override the developer's styles, for example the user might be
                                visually impaired, and want to set the font size on all web pages they visit to
                                be double the normal size to allow for easier reading.</p>

                        <!-- To Summarize -->
                        <h2>To summarize</h2>
                        <p>Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, with later ones
                                overriding earlier ones:</p>

                        <ol>
                                <li>Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles,
                                        used when no other styling is set).</li>
                                <li>Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).</li>
                                <li>Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us,
                                        the web developers).</li>
                                <li>Important declarations in author style sheets</li>
                                <li>Important declarations in user style sheets</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>It makes sense for web developers' stylesheets to override user stylesheets, so the
                                design can be kept as intended, but sometimes users have good reasons to
                                override web developer styles, as mentioned above â€” this can be achieved by
                                using <code>!important</code> in their rules.</p>

                <section class="main-section" id="The_Box_Model">
                        <header>The Box Model</header>

                        <!-- Block and Inline Boxes -->
                        <h2>Block and inline boxes</h2>
                        <p>In CSS we broadly have two types of box â€” <b>block boxes</b> and <b>inline boxes</b>.
                                These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow, and in
                                relation to other boxes on the page:</p>

                        <p>If a box is defined as a block, it will behave in the following ways:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in
                                        its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide
                                        as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.</li>
                                <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
                                <li>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are respected.
                                </li>
                                <li>Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from
                                        the box</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Unless we decide to change the display type to inline, elements such as headings
                                (e.g. <code>&#60h1&#62</code>) and <code>&#60p&#62</code>s all use
                                <code>block</code> as their outer display type by default.</p>

                        <p>If a box has an outer display type of <code>inline</code>, then:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
                                <li>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties will not apply.
                                </li>
                                <li>Padding, margin and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes
                                        to move away from the box.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The <code>&#60a&#62</code> element, used for links, <code>&#60span&#62</code>,
                                <code>&#60em&#62</code> and <code>&#60strong&#62</code> are all examples of
                                elements that will display inline by default.</p>

                        <p>The type of box applied to an element is defined by <code>display</code> property
                                values such as <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code>, and relates to the
                                <b>outer</b> value of <code>display</code>.</p>

                        <!-- Aside: Inner and outer display types -->
                        <h2>Aside: Inner and outer display types</h2>
                        <p>At this point we'd better also explain <b>inner</b> and <b>outer</b> display types.
                                As mentioned above, boxes in CSS have an outer display type, which details
                                whether the box is block or inline.</p>

                        <p>Boxes also have an <i>inner</i> display type, however, which dictates how elements
                                inside that box are laid out. By default the elements inside a box are laid out
                                in <b>normal flow</b>, which means that they behave just like any other block
                                and inline elements (as explained above).</p>

                        <p>We can however, change the inner display type by using <code>display</code> values
                                like <code>flex</code>. If we set <code>display: flex</code>; on an element, the
                                outer display type is <code>block</code>, but the inner display type is changed
                                to <code>flex</code>. Any direct children of this box will become flex items,
                                and will laid out according to the rules set out in the <span>Flexbox</span>
                                spec, which you'll learn about later on.</p>

                        <p>When you move on to learn about CSS Layout in more detail, you will encounter
                                <code>flex</code>, and various other inner values that your boxes can have, for
                                example <code>grid</code>.</p>

                        <p>Block and inline layout however is the default way that things on the web behave â€” as
                                we said above, it is sometimes referred to as <i>normal flow</i>, because
                                without any other instruction, our boxes lay out as block or inline boxes.</p>

                        <!-- Examples of different display types -->
                        <h2>Examples of different display types</h2>
                        <p>Let's move on and have a look at some examples. Below we have three different HTML
                                elements, all of which have an outer display type of <code>block</code>. The
                                first is a paragraph, which has a border added in CSS. The browser renders this
                                as a block box, so the paragraph begins on a new line, and expands to the full
                                width available to it.</p>

                        <p>The second is a list, which is laid out using <code>display: flex</code>. This
                                establishes flex layout for the items inside the container, however the list
                                itself is a block box and â€” like the paragraph â€” expands to the full container
                                width and breaks onto a new line.</p>

                        <p>Below this we have a block level paragraph, inside which are two
                                <code>&#60span&#62</code> elements. These elements would normally be
                                <code>inline</code>, however one of the elements has a class of block, and we
                                have set it to <code>display: block</code>.</p>

                        <p>Please refer to the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"
                                        target="_blank">MDN website</a> for the example image and code.</p>

                        <p>We can see how <code>inline</code> elements behave in this next example. The
                                <code>&#60span&#62</code>s in the first paragraph are inline by default and so
                                do not force line breaks.</p>

                        <p>We also have a <code>&#60ul&#62</code> which is set to <code>display:
                                        inline-flex</code>, creating an inline box around some flex items.</p>

                        <p>Finally we have two paragraphs both set to <code>display: inline</code>. The inline
                                flex container and paragraphs all run together on one line rather than breaking
                                onto new lines as they would do if they were displaying as block-level elements.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>In the example you can change <code>display: inline</code> to <code>display:
                                                block</code> or <code>display: inline-flex</code> to
                                        <code>display: flex</code> to toggle between these display modes.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>Please refer to the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"

                        <p>You will encounter things like flex layout later in these lessons; the key thing to
                                remember for now is that changing the value of the <code>display</code> property
                                can change whether the outer display type of a box is block or inline, which
                                changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout. </p>

                        <p>In the rest of the lesson we will concentrate on the outer display type.</p>

                        <!-- What is the CSS box model? -->
                        <h2>What is the CSS box model?</h2>
                        <p>The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some of the
                                behavior defined in the box model. The model defines how the different parts of
                                a box â€” margin, border, padding, and content â€” work together to create a box
                                that you can see on the page. To add some additional complexity, there is a
                                standard and an alternate box model.</p>

                        <!-- Parts of a box -->
                        <h4>Parts of a box</h4>

                        <p>Making up a block box in CSS we have the:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li><b>Content box:</b> The area where your content is displayed, which can be
                                        sized using properties like <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Padding box:</b> The padding sits around the content as white space; its
                                        size can be controlled using <code>padding</code> and related
                                        properties.</li>
                                <li><b>Border box:</b> The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its
                                        size and style can be controlled using <code>border</code> and related
                                        properties.</li>
                                <li><b>Margin box:</b> The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content,
                                        padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements.
                                        Its size can be controlled using <code>margin</code> and related
                                        properties.</li>
                        </ul>

                                        target="_blank">MDN website</a> to see the diagram that shows these
                                layers.</p>

                        <!-- The standard CSS box model -->
                        <h4>The standard CSS box model</h4>>

                        <p>In the standard box model, if you give a box a <code>width</code> and a
                                <code>height</code>, this defines the width and height of the <i>content</i>
                                box. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the
                                total size taken up by the box. This is shown in the image below.</p>

                        <p>If we assume that the box has the following CSS defining <code>width</code>,
                                <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and
                                <code>padding:</code></p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.box {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">width: 350px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">height: 150px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">margin: 25px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">padding: 25px;</span>
<span class="code-block-tab-1">border: 5px solid black;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <p>The space taken up by our box using the standard box model will actually be 410px
                                (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5), and the height 260px (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5), as the
                                padding and border are added to the width used for the content box.</p>

                        <p>Please refer to the diagram on the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"

                        <!-- The alternative CSS box model -->
                        <h4>The alternative CSS box model</h4>

                        <p>You might think it is rather inconvenient to have to add up the border and padding to
                                get the real size of the box, and you would be right! For this reason, CSS had
                                an alternative box model introduced some time after the standard box model.
                                Using this model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page,
                                therefore the content area width is that width minus the width for the padding
                                and border. The same CSS as used above would give the below result (width =
                                350px, height = 150px).</p>

                        <p>Please refer to the diagram on the<a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"
                                        target="_blank">MDN website</a>.</p>

                        <p>By default, browsers use the standard box model. If you want to turn on the
                                alternative model for an element you do so by setting <code>box-sizing:
                                        border-box</code> on it. By doing this you are telling the browser to
                                take the border box as the area defined by any size you set.</p>

                        <!-- Code Block -->
                        <pre><code>.box {
<span class="code-block-tab-1">box-sizing: border-box;</span>
}</code></pre>

                        <p>If you want all of your elements to use the alternative box model, and this is a
                                common choice among developers, set the <code>box-sizing</code> property on the
                                <code>&#60html&#62</code> element, then set all other elements to inherit that
                                value, as seen in the snippet below. If you want to understand the thinking
                                behind this, see the <a

                        <p>In the below example, you can see two boxes. Both have a class of <code>.box</code>,
                                which gives them the same <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>,
                                <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code>. The only
                                difference is that the second box has been set to use the alternative box model.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Can you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the
                                        <code>.alternate</code> class) to make it match the first box in width
                                        and height?</b></p>

                        <p>You've already seen the <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, and
                                <code>border</code> properties at work in the example above. The properties used
                                in that example are <b>shorthands</b> and allow us to set all four sides of the
                                box at once. These shorthands also have equivalent longhand properties, which
                                allow control over the different sides of the box individually.</p>

                        <p>Let's explore these properties in more detail.</p>

                        <!-- Margin -->

                                property, or each side individually using the equivalent longhand properties:
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Margin collapsing</b></p>

                        <p>A key thing to understand about margins is the concept of margin collapsing. If you
                                have two elements whose margins touch, those margins will combine to become one
                                margin, which is the size of the largest individual margin.</p>

                        <p>In the example below we have two paragraphs. The top paragraph has a
                                <code>margin-bottom</code> of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a
                                <code>margin-top</code> of 30 pixels. The margins have collapsed together so the
                                actual margin between the boxes is 50 pixels and not the total of the two
                                margins.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the example and code on the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"
                                        target="_blank">MDN website</a>.</p>

                        <p>There are a number of rules that dictate when margins do and do not collapse. For
                                further information see the detailed page on <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing"
                                        target="_blank">mastering margin collapsing</a>. The main thing to
                                remember for now is that margin collapsing is a thing that happens. If you are
                                creating space with margins and don't get the space you expect, this is probably
                                what is happening.</p>

                        <!-- Borders -->
                        <h4>Borders</h4>

                        <p>The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the
                                standard box model, the size of the border is added to the <code>width</code>
                                and <code>height</code> of the box. If you are using the alternative box model
                                then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of
                                that available <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.</p>

                        <p>For styling borders, there are a large number of properties â€” there are four borders,
                                and each border has a style, width and color that we might want to manipulate.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can set the width, color, and style of all four borders at once using the
                                <code>border</code> property.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the specific properties, example, and code on the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"
                                        target="_blank">MDN website</a>.</p>

                        <!-- Padding -->
                        <h4>Padding</h4>

                        <p>The padding sits between the border and the content area. Unlike margins you cannot
                                have negative amounts of padding, so the value must be 0 or a positive value.
                                Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding, and it
                                is typically used to push the content away from the border.</p>

                        <p>We can control the padding on each side of an element individually using the
                                <code>padding</code> property, or each side individually using the equivalent
                                longhand properties:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>padding-top</li>
                                <li>padding-right</li>
                                <li>padding-bottom</li>
                                <li>padding-left</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Refer to the example and code on the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"

                        <!-- The Box Model and Inline Boxes -->
                        <h2>The box model and inline boxes</h2>

                        <p>All of the above applies fully to block boxes. Some of the properties can apply to
                                inline boxes too, such as those created by a <code>&#60span&#62</code> element.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the example below we have a <code>&#60span&#62</code> inside a paragraph and have
                                applied a <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>,
                                <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code> to it. You can see that the width
                                and height are ignored. The margin, padding, and border are respected but they
                                do not change the relationship of other content to our inline box and so the
                                padding and border overlaps other words in the paragraph.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the example on the <a
                                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"

                        <!-- Using Display: Inline-block -->
                        <h2>Using display: inline-block</h2>

                        <p>There is a special value of <code>display</code>, which provides a middle ground
                                between <code>inline</code> and <code>block</code>. This is useful for
                                situations where you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want
                                it to respect <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> and avoid the
                                overlapping seen above.</p>

                        <p>An element with <code>display: inline-block</code> does a subset of the block things
                                we already know about:</p>

                        <ul>
                                <li>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are respected.
                                </li>
                                <li><code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>border</code> will
                                        cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It does not however break onto a new line, and will only become larger than its
                                content if you explicitly add <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
                                properties.</p>

                        <p>Refer to the example on the <a

                        <p>Where this can be useful is when you want to give a link a larger hit area by adding
                                <code>padding</code>. <code>&#60a&#62</code> is an inline element like
                                <code>&#60span&#62&#59</code> you can use <code>display: inline-block</code> to
                                allow padding to be set on it, making it easier for a user to click the link.
                        </p>

                        <p>You see this fairly frequently in navigation bars. The navigation below is displayed
                                in a row using flexbox and we have added padding to the <code>&#60a&#62</code>
                                element as we want to be able to change the <code>background-color</code> when
                                the <code>&#60a&#62</code> is hovered. The padding appears to overlap the border
                                on the <code>&#60ul&#62</code> element. This is because the
                                <code>&#60a&#62</code> is an inline element.</p>
